## Introduction

Granite City is an imagined rock climbing gym. This web app is a combination of a website and an e-commerce web app. The app is designed to do two things:

1. Provide information about Granite City climbing gym such as: general information about climbing, contact details and prices.
2. Allow users to access an e-commerce store where they can select climbing products to checkout and purchase (the final step of paying for items is unavailable).

## Technologies

This project is written with:

- React
- Redux
- SASS

## Features

- Shopping cart (state maintained by Redux) where you can select and remove products
- Numerous interactive routes composed of React components
- Fully responsive to all screen sizes

## Status

Project is: \_inProgress.

Further down the line, I would like to implement a full back end to the application. Additionaly I would like to include a payment gate to allow users to pay for the products.

## Inspiration

I'd been a member of a climbing gym similar Granite City in my hometown for quite a while however I moved to Aberdeen were no climbing gyms. I wrote this project as an imagination of an climbing gym which I would like to climb at.

At the time of starting this project, I was trying to learn Redux state management and was hoping that writing a project like this would give me a firmer grasp on many of the core principles.
